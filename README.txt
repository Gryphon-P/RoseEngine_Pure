ROSE_ENGINE / RoseEngine / rose_engine

ROSE_ENGINE is a custom game engine being created by Gryphon Picciottoli.
My intent with this project is to make a small game engine that aligns with my philosophies
in addition to allowing me greater creative freedom. If the goals of this project will change in the future, 
I am not sure. The "_Pure" just means I will not be using MSVS so that I can use the engine on multiple OSes.
